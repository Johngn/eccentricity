Recreation of plots from Ida et al 2020

 ### Ida et al 2020
 This code contains equations taken from Ida et al 2020. In that paper the authours discuss different prescriptions for calculating the rate of eccentricity damping of planetary embryos in a protoplanetary disc. It recreates figure 1 from that paper. Two different prescriptions are examined here. One by the authours themselves, and one from Cresswell and Nelson 2008.
 
 ### Getting started
 The scale height (h) and surface density (epsilon) of the gas disc can be changed to give different results, showing how the eccentricity damping depends on these two factors.
